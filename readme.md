This tool leverages YOLO, ONNX Runtime with DirectML, and Arduino integration to support gamers, especially those with physical challenges, providing a seamless and accurate aiming experience.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Uses ONNX models with non-max suppression for fast and reliable object detection.
- **Arduino Integration**: Enables additional control options through Arduino.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Allows extensive customization for targeting preferences, visuals, and integration.
- **Resource Management**: Employs garbage collection to optimize memory and system performance.

## Requirements
- **Python Libraries**: 
  - `torch-directml`, `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `psutil`, `colorama`, `pyautogui`, `PyGetWindow`, `yaml`, `tqdm`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `requests`, `dill`, `onnx`, `onnxruntime-directml`, `ultralytics`, `bettercam`, `dxcam`, `serial` (for Arduino), `cupy-rocm`.
- **Hardware**: 
  - AMD GPU for optimal performance with DirectML.
  - Optional: Arduino device (e.g., UNO) if `arduino_support` is enabled.
  - **Python 3.11.6**

### Running the Program

1.**Start the Application**:

```
python main_amd.py
```

2.**Configuration**: Adjust configuration in `config.py` before running for custom experience.

3.**Controls**:

- Press `CapsLock` to activate the aim assist.

- Press `8` to quit the program.

### Usage Examples

- **Model Loading**:

```
model = DetectMultiBackend(config.model_path, device=torch.device(config.device), dnn=False, fp16=config.fp16)
```

- **Arduino Integration**: If `arduino_support` is enabled, Arduino will assist in mouse movement based on detection results.

### Debugging and Visuals

The application includes a visualization mode (`visuals`=True in config) that displays real-time detection boxes, confidence percentages, and target tracking.

**Note**: Setting `cpsDisplay=True` will output the clicks per second (CPS) to monitor performance.
